This is BWReg2, BolerLAN Web Registration 2.

1. Quickinstall
2. Directory layout
3. Core features

1. Quickinstall
===============
There is no proper way of installing BWReg2 at this point, but the 
following should give you something to work with:
 1. Copy (or link) public_html somewhere. Possibly rename template.php
    to index.php
 2. Create a MySQL user and insert the login info into 
    public_html/subs/config.php
 3. Run mysql -uuser -ppassword db < sql/mysql.demo.sql 

 This will give you a demonstration of BWReg2, with some random content
 and a user. Using sql/mysql.sql will work too, but you'll need to manually
 create a user and set up the initial pages to get something usable. 
 By the time this is production-ready, there will be a more proper installation
 procedure.

2. Directory layout
===================
Documentation/  - Documentaiton of BWReg2. Consult this when in doubt.
public_html/ - Files to make public
sql/ - SQL Schema files, mainly MySQL atm.

3. Core features
================
- Host multiple genre of events (Multiple LAN parties sharing the same
  solution). The genre's are independent, but the users are shared. 
- ACL based permission control for maximum flexibility.
- Dynamic content. Even most error messages are stored in the database. 
  For convenience, a Wiki-markup is used for this. Who has access to what
  is easily defined based on ACL's. Customizing the menus is trivial.
- Dynamic event control. Just finished BolerLAN 07 winter and want to get
  started on the next lan? Just create a new event and data associated with
  the previous event is no longer cluttering the front page and similar.
- Easy registration of groups for administration purposes and others.
