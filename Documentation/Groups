1. Overview
===========
Groups in BWReg2 are fairly generic and can be used for many purposes.
The idea is that any sort of group can be stored in the same way, regardless
of the use. Creating and signing up for groups should be simple.

2. Creation of groups
=====================
Any user can create a group. This is a fundamental principle of BWReg2. There
are only one restriction: A group name may not start with "deleted", 
as this is reserved.

All groups belongs to a genre, except the the manually created bwreg2 admin
group(s). 

3. Signing up to groups
=======================
If the group is open, any user may sign up to it. If it is closed, noone can
sign up. If it is moderated, a user may request a signup. Requesting a signup
will add the user to the group with level 0.

4. Leaving groups
=================
Leaving groups should be equally trivial. A user may leave a group at any
time. A reason may be given, but will only be used in the log.

5. Administrating groups
========================
Initialy, only the owner of the group can administer a group. He or she
is the only person who can rename the group, and possibly "delete" the group.
A group never actually gets deleted, however. This is just a way of setting
the group to locked and postfixing the name with "deleted". The purpose of this
is to keep a history of old groups, and keep the groupid's live.

6. Group options
================
A group may have up to 25 group options. An option takes the form of C[n], where
C is a character, and n is an optional number. Most of these are for plugins, 
but some core options are:

l - locked
d - deleted
m - moderated
o - open  (A group must have one of ldmo, and only one)

Some suggestions for other options are:
c5 - compo, 5-man team
c3 - compo, 3-manteam
cN - compo, N members.
s - seating group
t - ticket group
