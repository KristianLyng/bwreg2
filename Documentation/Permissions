We base our permission system on groups.

Permissions
===========
gid Genre (not null)
eid EventID (null means genre at large)
resource Specific resource (other items link here), null means event at large.
resource_name Human readable name of the resource.
permission Defines what the group can do. (Read/Write/Modify)
group Group

Resource can typically be "Game" with permission set to rwm and group set
to the GameCrew group, while another entry with might be identical, but with
permission set to Read and group NULL, makeing it world-readable. 
Yet another identical entry could have rwm Permission with group set
to "AdminCrew" for instance.
