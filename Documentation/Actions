Actions in BWReg2
=================


1. What they are
2. How they can be triggered


1. What they are
================
An action is when BWReg2 does something dynamic. This can be printing userinfo
or showing version history of a page. More or less everything in BWReg2 is 
based upon actions. 

An action is not in any way BOUND to a specific page, even if it has a default
page in most of the links. There is nothing stopping a user from viewing the 
user registration form on the front page if he/she manipulates the URL. After
all, why would this really be a problem? Letting this happen, however, gives
us flexibility. 

2. How they can be triggered
============================

Actions are, most of the time, triggered by the user following a link or 
submitting a form with an action= field. BWReg2 registres action handlers
whcih are performed right before the page is outputed. 

There is one more way of triggering an action, by defining a default action
on a content page. This will ONLY trigger if no previous action was defined.
At this writing, the interface for doing this is still being planned, but
the idea is to easily enable admins to add dynamic content.

The keyword $ACTION:action$ will trigger this behavior. Other similar 
keywords will be supported for plugins (think polls, for instance).
As such, the maincontent class will have support for a get_keyword($keyword)
function, which will return false if no keyword is found, and the string
following if it is found, after removing it from the text. In other words,
the format is:

$KEYWORD:value$

surrounding it with ``'s, like other Text_Wiki markups, will cause it to
be ignored, and thus displayed.
